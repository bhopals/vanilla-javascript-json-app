## Understand JSON Data


**JSONP** - Json with Padding
    -    It is used to make cross domain request. While making any request, we need to ensure to add callback method 
         details that should accept JSON response.


### Working with JSON Schema

-   JSON Schema is sort of a blue print that how the data should look like.
-   Created by Internet Engineering Task Force.
-   It is used to validate/verify the JSON Response against the object response we are expecting to recieve 
    without processing. The schema simply validate and throw error in any invalidate data is sent. The 
    validation especifically includes required field or type of the value being passed.
